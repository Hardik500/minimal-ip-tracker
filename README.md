## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Login using SAWO sdk (the passwordless way)
- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

- After going through the resources provided, first I created a mock layout of the design provided
- After creating the dummy layout I added the Maps library and integrated it with the layout
- Since only the mobile-layout was provided so I created a mobile first layout and expected the desktop one to look similar with some changes here and there
- After that I integrated the IPIFY API and linked the function with the input action and useEffect, for fetching the initial user location
- Then I linked the output of IPIFY with that of the Leaflet
- After all of this got completed I started integrating the SAWO login using sawo-react and added the API keys and created a minimal workflow which just stores the current state after logging in
- After this I started the deployment using Github Pages and made the project live !!
